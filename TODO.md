- No 2x2 rule
- Timer so you can see how long a puzzle takes you
- Compatibility with codes from the [other gerrymandering website](https://imthegoat2024.github.io/gerryPuzzle/) that I didn't know existed when I started working on this (oops)
- Red outline around regions that break rules so you can more easily see e.g. which region has a tie
