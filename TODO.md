- No 2x2 rule
- Timer so you can see how long a puzzle takes you
- Compatibility with codes from the [other gerrymandering website](https://imthegoat2024.github.io/gerryPuzzle/) that I didn't know existed when I started working on this (oops)
- Better UI
- Rule for number of regions/cells per region
